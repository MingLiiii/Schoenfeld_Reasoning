[Understanding the Thinking Process of Reasoning Models: A Perspective from Schoenfeld's Episode Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14662)<br>(EMNLP'25)

This is the repo for the Schoenfeld_Reasoning project, which utilizes Schoenfeld's Episode Theory to analyze the reasoning traces for DeepSeek-R1. 

The repo contains: 

- The full SAT data we crawled, which contains not only SAT problems, but also metadata like skills, domains, and difficulties, which can be used for further analysis. 
- The full DeepSeek-R1 responses, and their corresponding paragraph-level and sentence-level episode annotations for our selected responses.

## Overview

While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate extensive chain-of-thought reasoning, we lack a principled framework for understanding how these thoughts are structured. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach by applying Schoenfeld's Episode Theory, a classic cognitive framework for human mathematical problem-solving, to analyze the reasoning traces of LRMs. We annotated thousands of sentences and paragraphs from model-generated solutions to math problems using seven cognitive labels (e.g., Plan, Implement, Verify). The result is the first publicly available benchmark for the fine-grained analysis of machine reasoning, including a large annotated corpus and detailed annotation guidebooks. Our preliminary analysis reveals distinct patterns in LRM reasoning, such as the transition dynamics between cognitive states. This framework provides a theoretically grounded methodology for interpreting LRM cognition and enables future work on more controllable and transparent reasoning systems.

## Highlights

* We propose the earliest exploration on applying Schoenfeldâ€™s Episode Theory to reasoning traces of LRMs, providing a unified view between how humans and LRMs solve math problems.
* We provide a theoretically grounded analytical framework for understanding and analyzing LRM thinking process from a cognitive view.
* We release the open annotation protocol and annotated corpus with thousands of annotations for the above-mentioned task, making it a well-defined task for controllable analysis.
