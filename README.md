# Understanding the Thinking Process of Reasoning Models: A Perspective from Schoenfeld's Episode Theory (EMNLP'25)


[Understanding the Thinking Process of Reasoning Models: A Perspective from Schoenfeld's Episode Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14662)<br>(EMNLP'25)

This is the repo for the Schoenfeld_Reasoning project, which utilizes Schoenfeld's Episode Theory to analyze the reasoning traces for DeepSeek-R1. 

The repo contains: 

- The full SAT data we crawled, which contains not only SAT problems, but also metadata like skills, domains, and difficulties, which can be used for further analysis. 
- The full DeepSeek-R1 responses, and their corresponding paragraph-level and sentence-level episode annotations for our selected responses.
